We reserve the right to reduce the prize payout consistent with the number of patrons playing each 
evening.  You must be 16 to play Bingo or the Event Games. 

Ball in TV is not good until called. Do not call Bingo early. Bingo does not have to be on the last 
number called. It is the player’s responsibility to the caller’s attention.  Yell Bingo loudly and hold your 
sheet in the air. 

We reserve the right to move the Progressive Game elsewhere in the program. Balls dropped by 
machine when incorrect Bingo is called are lost even if shown to patrons.
